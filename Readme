UNO_ARV_Programer was developed to enable the UNO to program the Atmega 328 family of devices, the Atmega644 and the Atmega32.  This gives the user access to 28 pin and 
40 pin devices with flash memory sizes betwwen 2 and 64kBytes.
Attiny devices are very important, they have less pins, a smaller footprint are cheeper and can supply more current per pin.  Version 2 of the programmer gives access to 
two families of Attiny devices: The Attiny 261, 461, 861 witrh 20 pins and up tro 8KBytes of flash and the ATtiny 24, 44, 84 with similar amounts of memory and 14 pins.
