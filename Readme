UNO_ARV_Programer was developed to enable the UNO to program the Atmega 328 family of devices, the Atmega644 and the Atmega32.  This gives the user access to 28 pin and 
40 pin devices with flash memory sizes betwwen 2 and 64kBytes.
Attiny devices are very important, they have less pins, a smaller footprint are cheeper and can supply more current per pin.  Version 2 of the programmer gives access to 
two families of Attiny devices: The Attiny 261, 461, 861 with 20 pins and up to 8KBytes of flash and the ATtiny 24, 44, 84 with similar amounts of memory and 14 pins.

However none of these devices has ports for an independent watch crystal (usually used with timer 2) or a UART.  The internal RC clock is calibrated using a signal suplied by
the UNO and placed on the programming clock pin.  THe UART function is supplied by a Universal sereial interface (USI).  This can be configured as a UART, I2C or SPI depending 
upon the code used to control it.

Atmel provide code for the UART application.  A timer zero interrupt provides the signal to clock the data in and out.  However significant delays are introduced by the 
interrup and actual timer delay is less than that obtained using simple calculation.  Here it has been obtained by trial and error and the maximun baud rate was found to be 78600.

A second implementation has therefore also been developed.  In this case all interrupts are replaced by polling.  In many cases the calculated vakues of trimer delay can be used
and with care a baud rate of 256000 can be used.
